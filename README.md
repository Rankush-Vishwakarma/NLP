# NLP-CODE-LIST
## In this repo I have created the completed NLP topic-wise description with their corresponding Examples. With this repo one can learn basics of NLP  with the implementation of different topic related to NLP . 

## Project 1 -  Sentiment analysis engine

## Project 2 -  Drug prescription using reviews


# Dataset Used: 

        1. I have used "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/amazon-alexa-reviews" kaggle dataset for the NLP analysis. 
        This data to analyze Amazonâ€™s Alexa product ; discover insights into consumer reviews and assist with machine learning models.You can also train your machine models for sentiment analysis and analyze customer reviews how many positive reviews ? and how many negative reviews ?
         
        2. on second analysis I have used "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/kuc-hackathon-winter-2018"  dataset.
        This dataset was used for the Winter 2018 Kaggle University Club Hackathon and is now publicly available. See Acknowledgments section for citation and licensing. Note: The types of data and recommendation based solutions provided by the contestants are purely for NLP learning purposes. They are not suitable for a real world drug recommendations solutions.
        Problem statement :- for the aquisition process the startup are required to tabulate all drugs that they have sold and accout for the drug effectiveness. provide a sophisticated and useful model and find out most useful drug for each condition.
