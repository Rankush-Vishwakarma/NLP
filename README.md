# NLP-CODE-LIST
## In this repo I have created the completed NLP topic-wise description with their corresponding Examples. With this repo one can learn basics of NLP  with the implementation of different topic related to NLP . 

## Project 1 -  Sentiment analysis engine
   I have used "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/amazon-alexa-reviews" kaggle dataset for the NLP analysis. 
        This data to analyze Amazonâ€™s Alexa product ; discover insights into consumer reviews and assist with machine learning models.You can also train your machine models for sentiment analysis and analyze customer reviews how many positive reviews ? and how many negative reviews ?
## Project 2 -  Drug prescription using reviews
   On second analysis I have used "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/kuc-hackathon-winter-2018"  dataset.
        This dataset was used for the Winter 2018 Kaggle University Club Hackathon and is now publicly available. See Acknowledgments section for citation and licensing. Note: The types of data and recommendation based solutions provided by the contestants are purely for NLP learning purposes. They are not suitable for a real world drug recommendations solutions.
        # Problem statement :- for the aquisition process the startup are required to tabulate all drugs that they have sold and accout for the drug effectiveness. provide a sophisticated and useful model and find out most useful drug for each condition.
        
## Project 3 -  yelp Data rating prediction 
   In this project I have used "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset" dataset.
   This dataset is a subset of Yelp's businesses, reviews, and user data. It was originally put together for the Yelp Dataset Challenge which is a chance for students to conduct research or analysis on Yelp's data and share their discoveries. In the most recent dataset you'll find information about businesses across 8 metropolitan areas in the USA and Canada.
   # In this project i have tried to predict the rating of the user comment/Reviews.
